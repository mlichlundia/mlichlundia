# Hi, everyone! Iâ€™m a professional Frontend Developer.

***

### Summary

I have gone through a mentoring program, courses. During studying I have worked
on commercial projects. Thanks to that I acquired not only good theoretical knowledge,
but also put that into practice on real projects.

I'm striving to write a clean, readable code by following best practices. While doing so I'm
collaborating closely with the team to make it best for all of us and help everyone improve
and learn from each other.

I am currently working for a company that is growing rapidly in its lively and friendly atmosphere.
